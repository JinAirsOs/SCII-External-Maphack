*CHANGES AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL CLASSES*
Program:
*Changed the error message if DWM is disabled.

OffsetReader:
*Parse now opens Offsets.xml with different settings to avoid denying access to another thread or program.

Unit:
*Units will now be updated before checking if they're invalid. And that check will use the updated data, instead of reading directly from SC2.
*Added the distance methods.
*Units will now be considered outdated if their model pointer changes. Hopefully this will update everything correctly for transforming units like Siege Tanks, Vikings and anything that burrows.

*The minimap now draws the local player's units in the normal green, and camera in white.
