fixed32:
*All traces of f32Raw have been removed. That constructor was replaced by an optional argument to the Int32 constructor.

GameData:
*Several places changed so mem gets reset after restarting SC2
*Exception handling changed so the program won't crash if it tries to read SC2Version too early.
*SecondsElapsed now returns -1 if the process isn't open. It also does not check if SC2 has exited for performance reasons.

OffsetReader:
*Now uses GameData.mem instead of its own.
*CheckVersion now returns true if GameData.SC2Version is "SC2 Closed".

Unit:
*When getting name or textID, addresses are checked against Int32.MaxValue instead of uint.MaxValue. Hopefully this will prevent overflows.
*The type of many properties has been changed from float to fixed32 to minimize unnecessary conversion.

DirectX_HUDs:
*The program will exit after too many frames have failed and the crash is reported.
*Exceptions while resetting the device will now be reported before reporting the exception that caused the reset.

MainWindow:
*Default Data and HUD refresh rates changed from 500 to 50.
*HUD refresh rate now limited to between 1 and 60000 inclusive. Over 60000 resets to the default of 50.
*Default GUI refresh rate changed from 1000 to 500.
*In GetUnits, unitOwner resets to 0 if it's >= 16.
*The program now checks to make sure a HUD is not disposed before showing or hiding it.
*The map size, players and units get updated on the first data refresh after the game starts, instead of waiting till the second.
*In UpdateRefreshes, the timout for getting a write lock has been lowered from 500 to 100.
