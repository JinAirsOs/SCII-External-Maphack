*GLOBAL CHANGES*
*This file was added.

*CHANGES TO MODULES*
Data:
*Selections have been fixed (but not yet tested). Big thanks to MyTeeWun for much of the new info.

2cs-API:
*Many things related to selections have been changed to work with the new selection system.

SC2 External Maphack:
*Started to remove some of the unused variables in MainWindow and DirectX_HUDs.

*CHANGES AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL CLASSES*
fixed32:
*f32Raw has been removed. That constructor was replaced by an optional argument to the Int32 constructor.

GameData:
*Several places changed so mem gets reset after restarting SC2
*Exception handling changed so the program won't crash if it tries to read SC2Version too early.
*SecondsElapsed now returns -1 if the process isn't open. It also does not check if SC2 has exited for performance reasons.

OffsetReader:
*Now uses GameData.mem instead of its own.
*CheckVersion now returns true if GameData.SC2Version is "SC2 Closed".
*Several functions for handling array elements now call the struct functions with the address of the element.
*Some other changes to support arrays of basic types in structs.

Unit:
*When getting name or textID, addresses are checked against Int32.MaxValue instead of uint.MaxValue. Hopefully this will prevent overflows.
*The type of many properties has been changed from float to fixed32 to minimize unnecessary conversion.

Player:
*cameraPitch is implemented.
*Selections are now implemented again.

DirectX_HUDs:
*Unit destinations will no longer be drawn for units with no current command.
*The map hud has been changed a bit to use different layering of units.
*The program will now exit after too many frames have failed and the crash is reported.
*Exceptions while resetting the device will now be reported before reporting the exception that caused the reset.

MainWindow:
*The time in the status bar now correctly shows minutes when the time is over an hour.
*Default Data and HUD refresh rates changed from 500 to 50.
*HUD refresh rate now limited to between 1 and 60000 inclusive. Over 60000 resets to the default of 50.
*Default GUI refresh rate changed from 1000 to 500.
*In GetUnits, unitOwner resets to 0 if it's >= 16.
*The program now checks to make sure a HUD is not disposed before showing or hiding it.
*The map size, players and units get updated on the first data refresh after the game starts, instead of waiting till the second.
*In UpdateRefreshes, the timout for getting a write lock has been lowered from 500 to 100.

Trainer:
*Added the Reset function to stop things from being frozen after a game ends and another is started.

Options:
*Added an error messagee when trying to use the Auto-size minimap option out of a game.

WT:
*The program will now close after reporting an exception. This will prevent endless loops of error messages.

*CHANGES TO OFFSETS.XML*
*Added an address to the AccountNumber struct. This is the address of the map-maker's account number.
*Added the CurrentSelections and Player Groups array, and the ControlGroup and Selection structs.
